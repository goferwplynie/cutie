`cutie remind [--nc]`
Checks the reminders file and displays encouraging messages for your projects.

A project is added to reminders if:

- It hasnâ€™t been modified for the number of days set with --reminder, or

- There is one week left until its deadline

--nc â€” turn off colored output (color is on by default)

ðŸ’¡ You can run this command automatically when your shell starts. It only checks for reminders in the file and doesnâ€™t add new ones unless the date changed. Reminders are always refreshed after adding a new project or when the date changes.
checks the reminders file and displays some encouraging texts for your project.

## Templates
project templates for faster project creation
example go.json file:
```
{
    "files":[
    "file.go",
    "internal/",
    "models/",
    "cmd/main.go"
],
    "commands":[
    "go mod init github.com/goferwplynie/$NAME",
    "echo -e 'package main\n\nfunc main(){\n}' > cmd/main.go"
]
}

```
templates are stored in config directory `cutie/templates`

available variables in templates:
- `$NAME` - project name

## Optional: auto-run cutie remind on terminal startup

To always check your project reminders, you can add this line to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):
```bash
cutie remind

```

## Future updates

for future i plan making better project template functionality by defining them with just files and folders. Also i plan on adding more variables for templates including env variables :3c
